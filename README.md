## Description:

(WIP) video chat app built with **node**, **express**, and **socket.io**

## to-do
-------------------------------

- figure out issue with firefox connections (general connectivity issues as well in other browsers) so more reasearch into sockets/websockets
- clean out the user interface
  * homepage / landing page has zero styling right now 
  * user bubbles need styling
- get the text chat portion working
  * chat panel has almost no styling.
  * maybe add emote panels?
